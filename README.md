# SARA-Q

**SARA-Q** is a cloud-based web application for quantifying upper limb motor coordination in patients with ataxia.
Part of the AtaxiaV system, SARA-Q is based on the traditional SARA test and enables remote, examiner-free assessments using touchscreen drawing tasks. High-resolution motion data is analyzed using various metrics to provide objective and reproducible results. AI-based personalization and rehabilitation features are currently under development.
